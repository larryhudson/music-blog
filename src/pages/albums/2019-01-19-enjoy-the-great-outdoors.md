I didn't like this band the first time I heard them. Spotify recommended the song 'Trust' which I think is a bit of a dirge. But then they recommended the song 'Mia' from his previous album, and I loved it. Much catchier. So I gave this album another go, and I like the vibe of it as an entire album.
